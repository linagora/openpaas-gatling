# Gatling OpenPaaS

This project enables to proceed to OpenPaaS load testing using [Gatling](https://gatling.io/) technology.  
It aims to provide building blocks, specific OpenPaaS APIs steps as well as more complex scenarios.

## Configuration

The configuration is defined in the `src/main/scala/com/linagora/openpaas/gatling/Configuration.scala` file.
However, all the parameters can be set through environment variables. Just copy the
**env.sh.tpl** file as **env.sh**, update the values and source it: `source env.sh`

Available settings:
 - OpenPaaS platform admin credentials for domain provisioning
 - Domain used for load testing
 - Platform admin & Domain admin credentials
 - Base URL for OpenPaaS endpoints
 - Base URL for Sabre endpoints
 - Base URL for Web Socket server
 - Base URL for Jmap server
 - User count for scenario
 - Scenario duration
 - Inject duration
 - Number of contacts per virtual user
 - Number of calendar events per virtual user
 - Number of emails per virtual user
 - Authentication strategy
 - Base URL for LemonLDAP portal page

Environment variables:
 - `OPENPAAS_HOSTNAME` which is set to `localhost` by default
 - `OPENPAAS_PORT` which is set to `8080` by default
 - `OPENPAAS_PROTOCOL` which is set to `http` by default (you can use `https` instead for example)
 - `SABRE_HOSTNAME` which is set to `localhost` by default
 - `SABRE_PORT` which is set to `8001` by default
 - `SABRE_PROTOCOL` which is set to `http` by default (you can use `https` instead for example)
 - `WEBSOCKET_HOSTNAME` which is set to `OPENPAAS_HOSTNAME` by default
 - `WEBSOCKET_PORT` which is set to `OPENPAAS_PORT` by default
 - `WEBSOCKET_PROTOCOL` which is set to `ws` by default (you can use `wss` instead for example)
 - `JMAP_HOSTNAME` which is set to `OPENPAAS_HOSTNAME` by default
 - `JMAP_PORT` which is set to `1080` by default
 - `JMAP_PROTOCOL` which is set to `OPENPAAS_PROTOCOL` by default
 - `INJECT_DURATION` which is set to `10` by default. Unit is second
 - `SCENARIO_DURATION` which is set to `10` by default. Unit is second
 - `USER_COUNT` which is set to `1` by default
 - `HUMAN_ACTION_MIN_DELAY` which is set to `7` by default. The minimum amount of seconds between 2 human actions.
 - `HUMAN_ACTION_MAX_DELAY` which is set to `15` by default. The maximum amount of seconds between 2 human actions.
 - `AUTHENTICATION_STRATEGY` which is set to `basic` by default (you can use `lemonldap`, `oidc` or `pkce` instead)
 - `OIDC_CLIENT` oidc client to use for `oidc` and `pkce` authentication strategies
 - `OIDC_CALLBACK` url to redirect to after a successful login with `oidc` and `pkce` authentication strategies. Make sure to add redirect URL with explicit port in the lemonLDAP manager
 - `LEMONLDAP_PORTAL_HOSTNAME` which is set to `auth.latest.integration-open-paas.org` by default.
 - `PLATFORM_ADMIN_USER` is the user name of the platform administrator.
 - `PLATFORM_ADMIN_PWD` is the password of the platform administrator.
 
For example, to run with OpenPaaS port `8000`:

```bash
$ export OPENPAAS_PORT="8000"
$ sbt
  > gatling:test
```

## User pool

There are two ways of creating a user pool for running tests:

1. Using a `src/test/resources/users.csv` file containing credentials of users.
This is the default method to retrieve user credentials. It is expected to have all users provisioned in the testing platform.

2. Including the provisioning steps in each scenario. This method requires platform admin credentials in configuration.

## Running tests in LemonLDAP integrated platform

For OpenPaaS instances that are protected by LemonLDAP, you need to provide the LemonLDAP portal page url in the configuration. You also have to change the `AUTHENTICATION_STRATEGY` configuration to `lemonldap`. Plus, all users credentials must be stored in `src/test/resources/users.csv` file.

## Gatling Recorder

The Gatling Recorder helps you to quickly generate scenarios, by either acting as a HTTP proxy between the 
browser and the HTTP server or converting HAR (Http ARchive) files. Either way, the Recorder generates a 
simple simulation that mimics your recorded navigation.

All the instructions to install and use are available at this [documentation](https://gatling.io/docs/current/http/recorder/?highlight=proxy)

## Run scenario

You can run all the scenario via sbt:

```bash
$ sbt
 > gatling:test
```

Run a specific scenario via sbt:

```bash
$ sbt
 > gatling:testOnly SCENARIO_FQDN
```

For example, you can run this scenario to open Calendar and open an event to view it details:

```
$ sbt
> gatling:testOnly com.linagora.openpaas.gatling.calendar.ViewEventDetailsSimulation
```
